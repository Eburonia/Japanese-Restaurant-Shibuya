## Bugs
* Floating problem: header section moves down together with article section when the top-margin of the article-section is set to 30px. This problem was solved by deleting the CSS rule float: left; in the navbar-div.  

## Testing
* Language flags are too big for iPad and smartphone, size to be adjusted.
* On smaller devices, the English flag stays on top of the Dutch flag, this should be otherway around, to be fixed.
* Map image will not center in section, to be fixed.

## fix
* Background image file to be resized.
* Make background image responsive.
