<!-- About -->
## About
These days there are still restaurant owners who are not active on the internet by owning a website or being active on social media.
By creating this example 'Japanese Restaurant Shibuya' website, we will show the importance of being active on the internet to these restaurant owners.
We will give them an idea how a typical restaurant website will look like and we will show what the added value for them is.
This website could also be valuable for restaurant owners who already own a personal restaurant website, but are looking for inspiration or new ideas.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
- To not get distracted too much, and for readability purposes, the used colours on the website meet the colours of the background hero image. Three types are used for styling the html elements:
   * Black: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85) - used in headers, footers, and sections background.
   * Cream colour type: rgb(195, 161, 104) - used in the restaurant logo text, h2 and h3 headers, sections, some divisions, image borders, buttons, form text fields, and form drop-down menus.
   * Smokewhite: rgb(245, 245, 245) - used in header, footer, navbar, paragraphs, menu items, and form labels.
- The sections ans some divisions of the website have a black transparent colour. This to keep the hero image in the background a little bit visible, but not too much that you can't read the text anymore.
- For emphasizing purposes a red colour is used for new menu items on the menu page and important messages like required text fields on the reservations and contact form.

#### Typography
- [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin#about) is the only font used throughout the website. Sans Serif is set as a fallback font type. Libre Franklin is a well-readable font. 
This font is based on the 1912 Morris Fuller Benton classic and was designed by Pablo Impallari, an Argentinian type designer based in Rosario.

#### Imagery
- A background image (hero) has been added to every page showing the restaurant's interior, giving the visitor an idea about the restaurant's atmosphere.
- Potential customers need to have an idea how some of the menu items might look like in reality. For that reason, every menu category has an example dish image belonging to that category added.
- All images are 'free to use' images, see the credit section for more information about them.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes belonging to the website's project have been made in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). PDF files of them can be found here:
- Wireframes of the Index Page - [link](https://github.com/Eburonia/japanese-restaurant-shibuya/blob/2ffdafa655a8ec6e7725af011a44c6b9dacfc1e8/wireframes/wireframes-index.pdf)

- Wireframes of the Reservations Page - [link](https://github.com/Eburonia/japanese-restaurant-shibuya/blob/2ffdafa655a8ec6e7725af011a44c6b9dacfc1e8/wireframes/wireframes-reservations.pdf)

All wireframes were designed for three different devices:
- Desktop - Web: maximum viewport width 1920px
- iPad - Nexus 9: maximum viewport width 768px
- iPhone - 12 Pro Max: maximum viewport width 428px

#### Mockups
The intention was to also create mockups for the website project. Due to the limited available time of the web developer, it has been skipped. Nevertheless, it is important to also invest time in creating mockups for future projects and won't be skipped next time.


<!-- Features -->
<a id="features"></a>
## Features

### Header
The header is located at the top of every page and exists out of the restaurant logo, navigation bar, and the preferred website language which are clickable language flags 'English or 'Dutch' and will be automatically loaded on every page.
* <b>Restaurant Logo</b> - The restaurant logo on the upper left side of the screen indicates the website is about a 'Japanese Restaurant' named 'Shibuya' and is a clickable link always redirecting the visitor to the website's index page.
* <b>The Navigation Bar</b> - The navigation bar is part of the header and will be intuitively found by the visitor. A Cream coloured stripe above a navigation item makes it clear to visitors on which active page they are on at the moment. The navigation bar will automatically change to a 'Hamburger' type navigation bar at smaller devices (smartphones). Hovering over a navigation bar item will change the colour making it clear to the visitor it's a clickable link.
* <b>Background Colour</b> - A black transparent background colour has been chosen for the header to keep the hero image in the background partly visible.
* <b>Language Flags</b> - Visitors can select the preferred language of the website in the header by clicking on one of the two available language flags 'English' or 'Dutch'. The website will be automatically loaded in the English language when landing on the homepage. By hovering over the flags, a tooltip will show up telling which language the flag represents.
* <b>Background Audio</b> - On the bottom right side of the header, a small audio player has been introduced. A 'Jazzy' audio file has been added to the audio player. To not disturb the visitor when landing on the website, you first need to push the play button to start the audio file. The audio file loops until you press the pause button.

### Footer
The footer has been located at the bottom of every page and exists out social media link, and a copyright notice.
* <b>Background Colour</b> - A black transparent background colour has been chosen for the footer to keep the hero image in the background partly visible.
* <b>Social Media Links</b> - Icons presenting social media platforms from the [fontawesome.com](https://www.fontawesome.com/) website are introduced as anchor links to redirect the visitor to the restaurant's external social media pages (blank page). By hovering over the links, the colour changes from Whitesmoke to Cream colour indicating these are clickable links.
* <b>Copyright Notice</b> - A clear copyright notice is visible at the bottom of the footer.

### Hero Background Image
A fixed hero image of the Restaurant interior has been added to every page.

### Sections/Divisions
Depending on which page you are on, the website has one or multiple sections/divisions containing content. You can recognize these sections/divisions by a black transparent container surrounded by a Cream coloured border including a border-radius. All sections/divisions start with a Cream coloured heading h2 with a [fontawesome.com](https://www.fontawesome.com/) icon at the end.

### Menu Page
The 'Menu' page exists out of a combination of sections (menu items) and divisions (images). These are inline next to each other for bigger devices. When the device width becomes too small, the sections and divisions will be on top of each other (block) to keep it readable.

### Forms
The forms on the 'Reservations' and 'Contact' pages both have the same styling. The labels, text fields, drop-down menus, and heading h2 will be smaller in size on smaller devices (smartphones) for readability purposes.

### Paragraphs
For consistency, all paragraphs have the same styling.

### Links
Only the index page has clickable links outside the header and footer of every page.
Links on the index page you can find in the 'Welcome' and 'About' sections of the page. The anchor links in the 'Welcome' section are styled in such a way they look like buttons and are styled the same way as the buttons used on the website. A button could no be used because JaveScript was needed to redirect them to the other pages, for that reason the anchor links were styled to look like a button.
The anchor links in the 'About' section are styled into a Cream coloured bold text to distinguish themselves from the remaining text. By hovering over the links, an underline will appear making it clear to the visitor these are clickable links. 

### Buttons
Buttons can be found on the Index, Reservations, and Contact page and are all styled the same way: Cream colour border and text and a black background. When hovering over the buttons also the background colour will change into a Cream type of colour, making it clear to the visitor it's a clickable button.

### Responsiveness
All pages are responsive on all devices. Minimum viewport width: 320px.

### Accessibility
* All images have been foreseen with an alternative (alt) text in case the image cannot be loaded. This also helps the screen readers.
* Aria-labels have been introduced where needed to give important information to the screen readers.

### Future Features
* Feedback from previous visitors can be found on the social media pages of the restaurant. To directly implement feedback on the website, a guestbook might be a good idea to incorporate on the website in the future.
* An older version of bootstrap has been implemented for the navigation bar only. To be updated to the latest version in the future.

### Further Testing
...

<!-- Known Bugs -->
<a id="bugs"></a>
## Known Bugs
- Slow loading time of the hero images and menu images when loading the website for the first time. The problem can probably be solved by reducing the file size.
- Loading the bootstrap navigation bar for the first time shows a small black border around the navigation bar, but will disappear when the custom CSS style of the navigation bar is loaded.
- Styling of audio player gives bad styling quality in Microsoft Explorer and Google Chrome.
- The date field on the reservations page works differently using Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox browsers. While clicking on the date field, a calendar pops up in Firefox, while this is not the case with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.  Here you have to manually add the day and month in the text field.
